And so, she has no other words other than she's so excited to spread love and spend her final year with her favourite society!"

While struggling to balance his degree and societies, he realised he could better spend the next year struggling to balance his degree, societies and MTSoc's finances. He hopes he can help others find the belonging and warmth he did in the society by not crashing it into crushing debt."

What better way to finish their biomed degree than to carefully craft MTSoc's posts and stories and captions, just like they do on their own account. They even curated this bio a month in advance. That's how much they love their job."
